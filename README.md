# Gallery Project
HTML and CSS responsive image gallery with description part about the projects. The HTML page contains a JavaScript function. During the work on this project, I learned:

1. Basics about Flexbox and its properties.
2. General Semantic Elements in HTML.
3. How to resize elements based on screen width.
4. How to adapt the layout of the gallery for mobile devices.
5. How to build a clickable button that opens and closes the description text.

## Step-by-step process:
1. Sketching a web page on the paper. 
2. Build basic elements of the html page (header, body, footer) and add sections. Add background colours for design convience.
3. Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices and in two columns on desktops.
4. Build a clickable button on each card that opens and closes the description text.
5. Resize cards based on screen width.
6. Adjust images horizontally within cards
7. Fill the page with content and add images.
Use Lorem Ipsum to descripe the projects numbered 3-6. Selecting the desired images by using Lorem Picsum. 
8. Correct the CSS-file by removing temporrary styles and adding final style touches.
